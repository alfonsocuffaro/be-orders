# be-orders
Back-end java project for managing orders.

It will be capable of allowing a front-end application to:

1. view/search orders stored in the system
2. display order information (along with associated products)
3. perform the usual CRUD operations on orders 
	- create
	- read
	- update
	- delete

In addition to all of the above it should be possible:

1. to track and manage product stock levels
